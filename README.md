Code is sometimes a bit sketchy and might trigger your antivirus.
It also needs Net Core 3.1 (you can check if you have Net Core 3.1 installed by typing "dotnet --info" in your cmd).
(Net Core 3.1 installation link: "https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/3.1")
It also only works in some paths because it can't access paths like "Desktop" idk why. But it can access drives example: (c:\(YourLogFileNamehere).
